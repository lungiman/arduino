## Arduino Assignment 2

This project deals with using arduino to study about sensors.

### Light Dependant Registers(LDR)

Light Dependant Registers (LDR's ) vary their resistance with the intensity of light falling on them.We use this as a sensor in the below circuit to vary the voltage being dropped over it. The varying voltage reading is passed on to a PWM pin to light up an LED to display the changes.
